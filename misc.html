        I like to blog <a href="https://medium.com/p/923b456c0560">here</a>, but I choose topics rather requisitely.

        Biggest vice is (not) youtube. Some of the people I like are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ididathing">I did
        a thing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarkRober">Mark Rober</a>, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd">MKBHD</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JerryRigEverything">JerryRigEverything</a>
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Sidemen">Sidemen</a>

        I picked up skateboarding during my Masters and have since become an annoying proponent for my friends. Apart from
        that,
        it's Tennis (or any other sport really), singing, board games, sporadic reading (<a
            href="https://qntm.org/fiction">qntm</a> is a recent favorite),
        and a few other things I like to believe I am still good at.

        I also like to read about startups (esp. <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies">YC</a>),
        case studies and how they operate.

        I (mostly) believe in <a href="http://slow-science.org/">Slow Science</a>.
    </li>

        I've become increasingly allergic to <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">500-pound websites</a>, hence
        this is made purely from html, css (and 30 lines of js).
