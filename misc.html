        I like to blog <a href="https://medium.com/@prathameshsonawane">here</a>, but I choose topics requisitely.
    </li>
    <li>
        Biggest vice is (not) Youtube. Some of the people I like are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ididathing">I did
        a thing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarkRober">Mark Rober</a>, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd">MKBHD</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JerryRigEverything">JerryRigEverything</a>
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Sidemen">Sidemen</a>

        Picked up skateboarding during my Masters and have since become an annoying proponent. Apart from
        that, I like to be outdoors. Tennis, singing, board games, ice-skating, hiking, sporadic reading (<a
            href="https://qntm.org/fiction">qntm</a> is a recent favorite),
        and the other things I like to believe I am still good at.
    </li>
    <li>
        I also like to talk about startups and biographies of people who worked in them. Personally I like to take things from 0->0.8 (0.8->1 can be slow/cumbersome if you are not careful).

        Love <a href="http://slow-science.org/">Slow Science</a> via Prof Efros. big fan.
    </li>

        I've grown increasingly allergic to <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">500-pound websites</a>. This
        this is hence built purely out of html and css.

        <a href="https://projects.kwon.nyc/internet-is-fun/">Internet used to be fun huh?</a>
