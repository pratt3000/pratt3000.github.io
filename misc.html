        I like to blog <a href="https://medium.com/@prathameshsonawane">here</a>, but I choose topics rather requisitely.
    </li>
    <li>
        Biggest vice is (not) Youtube. Some of the people I like are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ididathing">I did
        a thing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarkRober">Mark Rober</a>, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd">MKBHD</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JerryRigEverything">JerryRigEverything</a>
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Sidemen">Sidemen</a>

        Picked up skateboarding during my Masters and have since become an annoying proponent. Apart from
        that,
        it's Tennis (& other sports), singing, board games, sporadic reading (<a
            href="https://qntm.org/fiction">qntm</a> is a recent favorite),
        and the other things I like to believe I am still good at.
    </li>
    <li>
        I also like to read about startups (<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies">YC</a>), work in them
         and just take things from 0->1. (0.8->1 is very cumbersome if you join midway)

        Discovered <a href="http://slow-science.org/">Slow Science</a> via Prof Efros and since have become a big fan.
    </li>
    <li>
        I've grown increasingly allergic to <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">500-pound websites</a>. This
        this is hence built purely out of html and css.

        <a href="https://projects.kwon.nyc/internet-is-fun/">Internet used to be fun huh?</a>
