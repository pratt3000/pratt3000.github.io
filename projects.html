                    One of the more ambitious projects I've taken on. Regulatory complaince documents can be 500+ page
                    long and released by the government quite often. It takes take weeks to go interpret and map those changes
                    to a company's internal policies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    SmartDiff aims to solve this problem by bringing down the whole workflow from 2 weeks to a few hours by using LLMs to 
                    summarize, interpret and further map the changes to internal policies directly.

                    Other features include RAGs for question answering,
                    criticality tagger, a comnnunity driven platform for sharing insights and a lot more.
